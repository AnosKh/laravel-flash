This is a small, simple package to send flash messages in Laravel apps.  A flash message is a message that is carried over the next request.

This is how it can be used:

```php
class MyController
{
    public function store()
    {
        // â€¦

        flash(__('Post saved!'), 'my-class');

        return redirect()->to();
    }
}
```

In your view you can do this:

```blade
@if(flash())
    <div class="{{ flash()->class }}">
        {{ flash()->message }}
    </div>
@endif
```

## Installation

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-flash
```

## Usage

``` php
$skeleton = new Spatie\Skeleton();
echo $skeleton->echoPhrase('Hello, Spatie!');
```
